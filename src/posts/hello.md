FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Good evening, and welcome to the policy brief component of Storytime with Stormplup. You 
may be wondering how I am reaching you today, and the answer is that I am writing this
policy memo to inform you of important events directly from my desk, that is the desk
which currently belongs to a certain F. Morales until it is bought out. 

Now, on to brass tacks. 

It has come to my attention recently that there are many events that happened today,
September 22, 2022. We'll begin with pluppery and end with our new "Science in the Wild"
segment, which will be hosted by guest author C. Subramaniam. 

For our pluppery news, we'll go to our correspondent on the ground, Pip Trooper. 
Pip Trooper, how are you today? 

P.T. - Very well, very well, as well as can be expected, given the level of stink in the
room that I am currently in, that I also have no way out of in the forseeable future. 

S.P. - I'm very sorry to hear that. What would you say is the source of the stink? 

P.T. - You may be all too familiar with the answer, and can probably even predict it. 
Guess, Storm Plup. You are excellent at guessing, mysteriously enough just like the
culprit. 

S.P. - Hmmmm.... I must guess the one and stinky Francisco Morales. Is he the one? 

P.T. - He is the prime suspect at this moment. 

S.P - As always, a pleasure to have you on the show. 

P.T. - Thank you. 

S.P - And with that, we cut to our commercial break. Coming up is an exclusive story on 
how whales are dying in Taiwan, a country of great interest to plups around the world.

Commercial break in progress

Good evening, and welcome back. As you may be aware, there is a whale crisis in Taiwan, where interestingly enough, Pip Trooper and I are from. Although, some our readers/viewers might find this news segment distressing, I would be lying if I said we could not be happier. This is of course due to the fact that whales EAT penguins. Wait.. I'm getting something. Hold on? Pip Trooper, you are on the line!

P.T -- STORM PLUP, YOU ABSOLUTE STINK! WHALES??????? WHALES EAT SMALL KRILL AND FISH, NOT PENGUINS!!!!! #NOTALLWHALES

S.P - I think you are cutting out Pip, we'll get back to you once you recover your senses.

And that's all for today folks, remember, take out your trash. 

Thank you, and good night.
